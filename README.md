# LOAN-DEFAULT-PREDICTION-
End to end data analysis project using SQL ,MySQL Workbench and Power BI and Tableau
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to identify high-risk borrowers and predict potential defaults. By leveraging SQL for data processing and both Power BI and Tableau for visualization, I have created a comprehensive risk assessment system. This dual-tool approach demonstrates how different platforms can be used to drive the same business insights.
📊 Key Insights (Business Value)
Total Portfolio: Managed and analyzed a loan portfolio of $32.58 Billion.
Default Rate: The overall default rate for the portfolio is 11.61%.
High-Risk Segment: Borrowers in the 18-25 age group show the highest tendency to default.
DTI Correlation: Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratios exceeding 60% are a critical indicator of repayment instability.
Credit Health: The average credit score across the portfolio is 574.26, suggesting a significant sub-prime borrower base.
🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
MySQL Workbench: Used for data cleaning, feature engineering, and complex trend analysis (e.g., Age Bins, DTI Correlation).
Power BI: Built an Executive Summary Dashboard focusing on KPI metrics and strategic recommendations.
Tableau: Developed a Data Storytelling experience using "Story Points" to walk through specific risk demographics.
📑 Dashboard Components
KPI Cards: Total Loan Amount, Average DTI, Default Rate, and Avg Credit Score.
Age Wise Analysis: Visualizing loan distribution and default rates across different age brackets.
Loan Purpose: Analyzing risk based on the reason for the loan (Home, Education, Auto, etc.).
Strategic Recommendations: Data-driven suggestions for bank policy changes to mitigate risk.
